# tivaLab
In TivaLab Project I performed some TM4C123G LaunchPad Workshop labs (proposed in TM4C123G_LaunchPad_Workshop_Workbook.pdf), writing C code and running it on the Tiva board.

Actually that Workshop has been tested on Windows XP, 7 and 8. 
I’ve tested it on Windows 10 and I documented the problems I found and their solutions in a small report, RivaLab.pdf, where you can find needed tools and dependencies too. 


The code files are rich of comments. 
I performed homeworks too (they are all available here on this Github repository).


Each lab correspond to a different folder (1, 2, 6, and 7 are for setting up and testing the environment, so they don’t have a
folder):
- 3: GPIO
- 4: Interrupts and timers
- 5: ADC
- 6: Hibernation Module
- 8 : Memory
- 9: Floating Point Unit
- 12: UART
- 13: Micro DMA


If you like, you can change program files to change System behaviour.
